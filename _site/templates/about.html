<h2>Graphical ODE Solver - About</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the graphical ODE solver! This website is meant to help provide graphical solutions to a large class of ordinary differential equations. It is also possible to examine the solution to first order differential equations and graphically compare the solution to what one would get if they applied one of few numerical methods. 
</p>

<h3>Graphical Solver</h3>
<p>
  On the Main page of this website, you can enter the details of your differential equation and see the resulting graph. Make sure that your input for the order is a positive integer; the initial conditions should be separated by commas and in increasing order of derivation (ie. first \(y(0)\), then \(y'(0)\), then \(y''(0)\) and so on) with the same number of conditions as the inputted order; the differential equation, following any notes regarding the input on the page; and the final time you wish to view the plot for (can be negative, too!). As of now, initial conditions must be at time t=0 and the initial view time is also t=0. However, to view the right-hand-side of the solution, enter a positive number. To view the left-hand-side of the solution, ie. "run time backwards", enter a negative number. The differential equation, initial conditions and final view time all support basic mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, as well as arccos, arcsin and arctan. Also available is sqrt, ln or log, and exponentiation ^. Constants pi and e are also valid inputs.

This graphical tool can handle most differential equations that can be written in the form \(\frac{dy^{n}}{dt^{n}} = f(t,y,y',y'',...,y^{(n-1)})\). If the plot has a very sudden spike/drop at a certain time, this may hint at the possibility that the solution blows up in finite time; due to the underlying tools, it may show this as a sharp spike in the curve, but mathematically it may not be defined at that time point and afterwards. In such a case, further mathematical analysis of the differential equation would be needed to correctly identify what occurs at that time.

<h3> Numerical Methods Solver</h3>
<p>On the Numerical Methods page, you will be able to solve a differential equation of the form \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y) \) as well as see the resulting approximation of the solution using one or more of the available numerical methods. The same functions and constants are usable for the differential equation, however this may not have a \(y'\) or higher derivative since it is restricted to first order ODEs. The initial condition is also evaluated at the initital time \(t_{0}=0\), and the final view time can only be positive. The step size must also be a positive number (of course, a non-positive step size wouldn't make any sense!). To view just one curve on the plot, double-click that item in the legend. To hide one of the curves, click once on the item in the legend and click again to make it reapprear. </p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Under the hood, the webapp takes in the provided inputs and makes sure they're all valid. If something went wrong, a new note will pop up stating what went wrong and what needs to be fixed. If all inputs are accepted, then they are passed to a Python function that breaks down the \(n\)th order ODE into a system of \(n\) first order ODEs. It then uses the 'odeint' function provided by scipy.integrate to find a numerical solution. The solution is then plotted using Plotly Express to provide an interactive graph that shows what the function evaluates to at any given point on the curve. A similar process goes on for the Numerical Methods page, except the solution is evaluated manually following the idea of each method. All selected methods as well as the actual solution are all plotted together to show how they compare to each other. </p>
